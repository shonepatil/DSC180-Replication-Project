# GCN and FCN Code

This repository contains code for a project running GCN or FCN on SNAP datasets.

The purpose was to compare the two methods and even combine them to carry out node classification tasks on graphs. The current project looks at Twitch friend network data and looks to classify users as having Mature content or not.
